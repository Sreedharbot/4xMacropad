## Firmware Choice Instruction

If you are assembling the PCB with standard numpad layout, use the 4x5numpad firmware

If you are assembling the PCB with macro-numpad layout (aka populate all 20 switches), use the 4x5 macro-numpad layout.

To customize the key presses, see actions.ino. You will need to program the key-down event (i.e. when the key is just pressed) and the key-up event (i.e. when the key is just released) seperately.
