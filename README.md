## CH552G DIY Mechanical Keyboard Archives
This archive stores all the required design files for DIY macropads / keyboard of all sizes and layouts. If you are not experience enough to build one or you just want to get a sample before making a few for yourself, you can also find pre-assembled samples on my [Tindie Store](https://www.tindie.com/stores/tobychui/). 

Gerber files of PCB files will be released with each of the new layout release without the schematics. The schematics will be released following the next layout / design to make sure I got enough funding to iterate more layout and open source them for free. Thank you for your understanding!

## 4xMacropad

An ultra low cost, 4 keys mechanical macropad using CH552G. See the ```/4xMacropad/ ```folder.

## 4x5 Macro-numpad

Another ultra low cost macropad + numpad powered by CH552G with two layouts on the same PCB. See the ```/4x5Macro-Numpad/``` folder.

### Build Instruction

1. Send the PCB to print (See /PCB)

2. Purchase all the required materials (See BOM list)

3. 3D print the base plate (See /3D Model)

4. Install the required Arduino library for CH552G and drivers

5. Visit [4-key Macropad | imuslab](https://tobychui.github.io/4xMacropad/) (4xMacropad only) or modify the sketch in /firmware folder

6. Flash the CH552G with the sketch

### Program Flashing Instructions

As all the keyboard designs share the same MCU and programming button design, this instruction should be suitable for all the macropads / numpad in this repo.

1. Hold and press the PROG button on the PCB

2. While the button has been held, insert the USB cable into the mini USB port

3. Release the button when the Arduino code has finished compiling and ready to upload (Timing is important)

4. Wait for the upload to complete

### For Windows

   This is a discovery for me â€“ in Windows OS, the macro-pad functions only with the installation of the correct driver. Therefore, I suggest users install this software to flash Arduino code into their macro-pad.

   WCHIP Studio - [Click Here to install the driver](https://www.wch-ic.com/downloads/WCHISPTool_Setup_exe.html).

   After installing the driver. Verify your sketch in Arduino and locate the ".hex" file from Arduino.
